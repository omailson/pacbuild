pacbuild: a less automagic way to download packages from AUR

This script is for those arch linux users who want more control on their AUR
packages but don't want to download and compile each dependency individually.

pacbuild won't install the packages for you, instead it will download the
package and its dependencies (using `cower') to a folder and generate a script
with the building steps. Edit the script if you want to change one of the
building steps.
